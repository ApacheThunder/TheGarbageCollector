TheGarbageCollector v1.1

Got lots of mods? Got lots of random hitches/frame drops happening at inoppertune times? Also have lots of ram in your PC you don't know what to do with?

Then install this mod! It disables Unity's GarbageCollector. Well not entirely because I'm not that insane. :P

Instead it manually controls when GC can run. It will allow it to run during floor loads and while game is paused 
or if player is afk out of combat for more then 5 minutes.

It otherwise allows for a much smoother game play experience! Do note this will cause the game to use more ram. 
A machine with 8GB or more of ram is recommended. Though I won't prevent you from using it if you have less, but don't don't complain to me if you 
get out of memory errors. This game will on average use about 4.5GB of ram during a normal run that reachs the Forge. 
It can go to 5GB+ if you use specific items that create new rooms and such. But that probably won't happen that often.

I've stress tested this. It should be ok to use as long as you have a decent amount of ram. 
Oh and definitely don't use this with the 32bit version of the game....For obvious reasons. :P
